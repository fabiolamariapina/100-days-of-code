# color example
# color = input("What's you favorite color?")
# print(f"You said {color}")

# run same code ad above but as a print statement
# unlike the first bit of code, the input is entered on the next line
# looks better to me personally
print("What is your favorite color?")
color = input()
print(f"You said {color} ")
