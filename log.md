# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 20, 2020

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: created api for my makeup organizer app, got all my routes and models working, created basic react app, did not edit anything on basic react app

**Thoughts:** Overall, I feel like I am getting better with setting up the API of a react app. I was able to do most of it by memeory and understand the why behind the code, but there are a few things I forgot. If I did forget something, I referred to my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive notes. Out of everything I did today, the most intuitive was creating my basic react app.

### Day 2: November 21, 2020

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Tried version control to begin working on my app's landing page and did not work out due to various issues I had with Git, recreated my API from yesterday,

**Thoughts**: For day 2 of 100 Days of Code, I tried to focus on creating the front-end of my app using React and to practice version control using Git. However, it all went downhill the moment I decided to create a git branch for my landing page. At first, everything was fine when I created a git branch for my landing page. Reflecting on today, I realize the problems began when every time I pushed a change to my landing branch that worked, I did not immediately merge it with my master branch. Trying to fix the problems caused by this mistake I made just kept getting more and more difficult. In a moment of frustration and rage (and not my proudest moment), I deleted my whole app. Thus, I started over again, recreating the API and react app from yesterday. Once I recreated my API and set up my react app, it was time to begin creating my landing page. Today, I was able to get all the components of my landing page rendered and style it. I still have to fix some image sizing and positioning issues. Once I resolve those issues, I plan to add my react-router and create a component for my landing page.

### Day 3: November 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I mostly spent my time styling my landing page using CSS.

**Thoughts** For day 3 of 100 days of code, I spent it styling the landing page of my makeup organizer app using CSS. Overall, I would consider CSS one of my main strengths, thus making it an easy day, especially compared to yesterday. My favorite part of the day was making my code dry because it nothing makes me more satisfied than DRY code.

### Day 4: November 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished styling landing page and installed my react router.

**Thoughts** For day 4 of 100 days of code, I added the finishing touches to my landing page. I tried to experiment with my styling by using materialize. It did not turn out the way I envisioned, but materialize is definitely a CSS framework I want to experiment with in one of my next few projects. My next challenge was to install my router. This is only my second time using a React router, but it went better than I expected. I feel like I am finally understanding how the react-router works and how to install it. It is a technology I want to continue working with. My highlight of today was finally being able to do version control using Git. It felt especially awesome because I was having trouble with it on day 2. If I can improve and grow that much in less than a week, I am excited to see what the remaining days of this challenge will bring.

### Day 5: November 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continues setting up my react router and was able to render an index/show page with my router.

**Thoughts** For day 5 of 100 days of code, I took it easy compared to the other days. Since it's Thanksgiving week, I am not in much of a working mood as usual. Instead of beating myself up for not doing "enough" work, I am instead proud of myself for doing a tiny bit. The cliche "a little goes a long way" is a cliche for a reason. I finally finished setting up my react-router and I have a better understanding of how it works compared to yesterday. Now that I have a react-router, I am now also able to render an index/show page. My next step is to bring in and render the data from my API for the index page.

### Day 6: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried passing props to render data on index page, data is still not rendering.

**Thoughts** For day 6 of 100 days of code, I took it even easier than I did on Thursday. I honestly thought I would be in the state of mind to be able to code these past few days, but Thanksgiving (and by Thanksgiving, I mean Thanksgiving food) was calling my name. After a two day hiatus, I am finally back in the game. Today, I focused on trying to render the data I entered while testing the routes I created in my backend. According to my React app, there are no mistakes, but nothing is being added to my index page and I am completely stuck here.

### Day 7: November 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the index page, created the new form page

**Thoughts** For day 7 of 100 days of code, I decided to take a break from the index page and shift my focus to my new form page. Unfortunately, I still have not solved the problems I had yesterday with rendering my index page. Instead of getting frustrated, I shifted my energy to something else. I began by creating a NewForm.jsx component and then added it to the router in App.js. By now, this process has become second nature. I then added most of the inputs I want for my form and and a submit button. However, there are two inputs missing in my form that were in my back-end schema. The first is the type of makeup. My plan is to do this one tomorrow since I need extra time to figure out how to add a drop down menu in React. The second input I am missing is my buyMore input. This is because I do not fully understand how to work with booleans in React. I do not know if I am overthinking it and it really is a simple concept. My goal with the buyMore input is to eventually allow the user to check "yes" if they need to buy more in order for the product to be added to the user's shopping cart. My goal tomorrow is to work on the styling of my form and to figure out the type and buyMore inputs. Overall, today was a productive day of coding because I practiced ideas and concepts that I am really beginning to understand. Today has also confirmed that React is my JavaScript library of choice.

### Day 8: November 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began creating a drop down menu and styling my new form page.

**Thoughts** For day 7 of 100 days of code, I began working on my drop-down menu. For this section, I followed this tutorial from blog.campvanilla.com: https://lnkd.in/gbnVvzR. I took my time looking at and writing the code in order to understand it better. Even though I have not gained a full understanding of drop-down menus in react, I am better than I was yesterday. However, I hit a roadblock when I wrote the code to close the menu. Every time I wrote it, the menu would not even open. Since I spent a good amount of time frustrated, I switched to styling the page. At first, I was doing well with styling my new form page by using Flexbox. Here, I hit another roadblock when nothing seemed to work to space out and center my form, which I plan on keeping in a column format. I also spent a long time frustrated in this part. Since my minimum one hour of coding time was over, I decided to take my mind off this project and come back to it tomorrow.

### Day 9: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Centered my new form and styled butttons and inputs, began reviewing data structure on freecodecamp.com

**Thoughts** For day 9 of 100 days of code, I decided on a new system. For the first half of my coding time, I will dedicate it to working on my portfolio and its projects. The second half will be preparing for technical interviews. Today, the first half of my coding time today consisted of me styling my new form page. I was finally able to center the form in the way I wanted, but the spacing is still not there. This problem is why I sometimes hate flexbox. I could be styling exactly the way the tutorials tell me but nothing happens. I also styled my buttons and inputs by adding a border-radius to give them a rounded appearance and changing the color of my buttons to be exactly like those on the landing page. For the second half of my coding time, I went back and reviewed the JavaScript basics on free code camp. Since technical interviews focus on data structures and algorithms, I began my interview preparation by beginning the Introduction to the Basic Data Structure Challenges, which can be found here (https://lnkd.in/gZN6FY9). I want to master the basics to succeed in technical interviews.

### Day 10: December 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began the Learn JavaScript course on Code Academy, completed up to lesson 3 of module 2, conditionals.

**Thoughts** For day 10 of 100 days of code, I decided to take a break from my makeup organizer app since I've been stuck and frustrated with it. I plan on returning to it within the next few days. I will be using my coding time in the next few days to really master the basics of JavaScript. My purpose in doing so is to have the skills needed to succeed in a technical interview. I also want to use this time to practice talking through my practice problems as if it were a technical interview. Today, I made it through lesson 1 and began lesson 2 of Code Academy's Learn JavaScript course. While doing this course, I rembered things I have forgotten throughout my coding journey, such as reassigning let variables and that when let variables are not initialized, they will return as undefined.

### Day 11: December 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished conditionals module of Learn JavaScript on Code Academy, began functions module

**Thoughts** For day 11 of 100 days of code, I continued the Learn JavaScript course on Code Academy. I finished the conditionals module and learned a lot of concepts that I have touched on only briefly during my coding journey. They are truthy and falsy, switch statements, ternary operators, and short circuit evaluation. Since these seem to be the current JS best practices, my goal is to further my understanding of these concepts and use them when I code. I also began the functions module I learned in JavaScript. I learned nothing new, but it was nice to review functions in a way that has not been explained to me to deepen my understanding.

### Day 12: December 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished functioms module of Learn JavaScript on Code Academy, began scope module, began The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp on Udemy

**Thoughts** For day 12 of 100 days of code, I finished the functions module of Learn JavaScript on Code Academy. There were ways of doing functions that I have done before and some I have not, like anonymous functions, function expressions, and concise body arrow functions. I also deepened my understanding of helper functions to the point where I think I am comfortable using them. Once I finished this module, I completed the first two, albeit basic, lessons of the scope module. I have learned about scope before and understood it, but focusing on completing a lesson on just code blocks helped me understand scope better. After focusing on JavaScript, I switched to another language I began learning this week in my bootcamp. This whole week, I have been struggling with Python, so I decided to sign-up for the self-paced Modern Python 3 Bootcamp on Udemy. I did not code much, except for the first coding exercise where I had to print my name.
