# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 20, 2020 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: created api for my makeup organizer app, got all my routes and models working, created basic react app, did not edit anything on basic react app

**Thoughts:** Overall, I feel like I am getting better with setting up the API of a react app. I was able to do most of it by memeory and understand the why behind the code, but there are a few things I forgot. If I did forget something, I referred to my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive notes. Out of everything I did today, the most intuitive was creating my basic react app.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
