# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 20, 2020

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: created api for my makeup organizer app, got all my routes and models working, created basic react app, did not edit anything on basic react app

**Thoughts:** Overall, I feel like I am getting better with setting up the API of a react app. I was able to do most of it by memeory and understand the why behind the code, but there are a few things I forgot. If I did forget something, I referred to my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive notes. Out of everything I did today, the most intuitive was creating my basic react app.

### Day 2: November 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried version control to begin working on my app's landing page and did not work out due to various issues I had with Git, recreated my API from yesterday,

**Thoughts**: For day 2 of 100 Days of Code, I tried to focus on creating the front-end of my app using React and to practice version control using Git. However, it all went downhill the moment I decided to create a git branch for my landing page. At first, everything was fine when I created a git branch for my landing page. Reflecting on today, I realize the problems began when every time I pushed a change to my landing branch that worked, I did not immediately merge it with my master branch. Trying to fix the problems caused by this mistake I made just kept getting more and more difficult. In a moment of frustration and rage (and not my proudest moment), I deleted my whole app. Thus, I started over again, recreating the API and react app from yesterday. Once I recreated my API and set up my react app, it was time to begin creating my landing page. Today, I was able to get all the components of my landing page rendered and style it. I still have to fix some image sizing and positioning issues. Once I resolve those issues, I plan to add my react-router and create a component for my landing page.

### Day 3: November 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I mostly spent my time styling my landing page using CSS.

**Thoughts** For day 3 of 100 days of code, I spent it styling the landing page of my makeup organizer app using CSS. Overall, I would consider CSS one of my main strengths, thus making it an easy day, especially compared to yesterday. My favorite part of the day was making my code dry because it nothing makes me more satisfied than DRY code.

### Day 4: November 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished styling landing page and installed my react router.

**Thoughts** For day 4 of 100 days of code, I added the finishing touches to my landing page. I tried to experiment with my styling by using materialize. It did not turn out the way I envisioned, but materialize is definitely a CSS framework I want to experiment with in one of my next few projects. My next challenge was to install my router. This is only my second time using a React router, but it went better than I expected. I feel like I am finally understanding how the react-router works and how to install it. It is a technology I want to continue working with. My highlight of today was finally being able to do version control using Git. It felt especially awesome because I was having trouble with it on day 2. If I can improve and grow that much in less than a week, I am excited to see what the remaining days of this challenge will bring.
