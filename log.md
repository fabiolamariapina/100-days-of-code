# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 20, 2020

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: created api for my makeup organizer app, got all my routes and models working, created basic react app, did not edit anything on basic react app

**Thoughts:** Overall, I feel like I am getting better with setting up the API of a react app. I was able to do most of it by memeory and understand the why behind the code, but there are a few things I forgot. If I did forget something, I referred to my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive notes. Out of everything I did today, the most intuitive was creating my basic react app.

### Day 2: November 21, 2020

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Tried version control to begin working on my app's landing page and did not work out due to various issues I had with Git, recreated my API from yesterday,

**Thoughts**: For day 2 of 100 Days of Code, I tried to focus on creating the front-end of my app using React and to practice version control using Git. However, it all went downhill the moment I decided to create a git branch for my landing page. At first, everything was fine when I created a git branch for my landing page. Reflecting on today, I realize the problems began when every time I pushed a change to my landing branch that worked, I did not immediately merge it with my master branch. Trying to fix the problems caused by this mistake I made just kept getting more and more difficult. In a moment of frustration and rage (and not my proudest moment), I deleted my whole app. Thus, I started over again, recreating the API and react app from yesterday. Once I recreated my API and set up my react app, it was time to begin creating my landing page. Today, I was able to get all the components of my landing page rendered and style it. I still have to fix some image sizing and positioning issues. Once I resolve those issues, I plan to add my react-router and create a component for my landing page.

### Day 3: November 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I mostly spent my time styling my landing page using CSS.

**Thoughts** For day 3 of 100 days of code, I spent it styling the landing page of my makeup organizer app using CSS. Overall, I would consider CSS one of my main strengths, thus making it an easy day, especially compared to yesterday. My favorite part of the day was making my code dry because it nothing makes me more satisfied than DRY code.

### Day 4: November 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished styling landing page and installed my react router.

**Thoughts** For day 4 of 100 days of code, I added the finishing touches to my landing page. I tried to experiment with my styling by using materialize. It did not turn out the way I envisioned, but materialize is definitely a CSS framework I want to experiment with in one of my next few projects. My next challenge was to install my router. This is only my second time using a React router, but it went better than I expected. I feel like I am finally understanding how the react-router works and how to install it. It is a technology I want to continue working with. My highlight of today was finally being able to do version control using Git. It felt especially awesome because I was having trouble with it on day 2. If I can improve and grow that much in less than a week, I am excited to see what the remaining days of this challenge will bring.

### Day 5: November 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continues setting up my react router and was able to render an index/show page with my router.

**Thoughts** For day 5 of 100 days of code, I took it easy compared to the other days. Since it's Thanksgiving week, I am not in much of a working mood as usual. Instead of beating myself up for not doing "enough" work, I am instead proud of myself for doing a tiny bit. The cliche "a little goes a long way" is a cliche for a reason. I finally finished setting up my react-router and I have a better understanding of how it works compared to yesterday. Now that I have a react-router, I am now also able to render an index/show page. My next step is to bring in and render the data from my API for the index page.

### Day 6: November 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried passing props to render data on index page, data is still not rendering.

**Thoughts** For day 6 of 100 days of code, I took it even easier than I did on Thursday. I honestly thought I would be in the state of mind to be able to code these past few days, but Thanksgiving (and by Thanksgiving, I mean Thanksgiving food) was calling my name. After a two day hiatus, I am finally back in the game. Today, I focused on trying to render the data I entered while testing the routes I created in my backend. According to my React app, there are no mistakes, but nothing is being added to my index page and I am completely stuck here.

### Day 7: November 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from the index page, created the new form page

**Thoughts** For day 7 of 100 days of code, I decided to take a break from the index page and shift my focus to my new form page. Unfortunately, I still have not solved the problems I had yesterday with rendering my index page. Instead of getting frustrated, I shifted my energy to something else. I began by creating a NewForm.jsx component and then added it to the router in App.js. By now, this process has become second nature. I then added most of the inputs I want for my form and and a submit button. However, there are two inputs missing in my form that were in my back-end schema. The first is the type of makeup. My plan is to do this one tomorrow since I need extra time to figure out how to add a drop down menu in React. The second input I am missing is my buyMore input. This is because I do not fully understand how to work with booleans in React. I do not know if I am overthinking it and it really is a simple concept. My goal with the buyMore input is to eventually allow the user to check "yes" if they need to buy more in order for the product to be added to the user's shopping cart. My goal tomorrow is to work on the styling of my form and to figure out the type and buyMore inputs. Overall, today was a productive day of coding because I practiced ideas and concepts that I am really beginning to understand. Today has also confirmed that React is my JavaScript library of choice.

### Day 8: November 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began creating a drop down menu and styling my new form page.

**Thoughts** For day 7 of 100 days of code, I began working on my drop-down menu. For this section, I followed this tutorial from blog.campvanilla.com: https://lnkd.in/gbnVvzR. I took my time looking at and writing the code in order to understand it better. Even though I have not gained a full understanding of drop-down menus in react, I am better than I was yesterday. However, I hit a roadblock when I wrote the code to close the menu. Every time I wrote it, the menu would not even open. Since I spent a good amount of time frustrated, I switched to styling the page. At first, I was doing well with styling my new form page by using Flexbox. Here, I hit another roadblock when nothing seemed to work to space out and center my form, which I plan on keeping in a column format. I also spent a long time frustrated in this part. Since my minimum one hour of coding time was over, I decided to take my mind off this project and come back to it tomorrow.

### Day 9: December 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Centered my new form and styled butttons and inputs, began reviewing data structure on freecodecamp.com

**Thoughts** For day 9 of 100 days of code, I decided on a new system. For the first half of my coding time, I will dedicate it to working on my portfolio and its projects. The second half will be preparing for technical interviews. Today, the first half of my coding time today consisted of me styling my new form page. I was finally able to center the form in the way I wanted, but the spacing is still not there. This problem is why I sometimes hate flexbox. I could be styling exactly the way the tutorials tell me but nothing happens. I also styled my buttons and inputs by adding a border-radius to give them a rounded appearance and changing the color of my buttons to be exactly like those on the landing page. For the second half of my coding time, I went back and reviewed the JavaScript basics on free code camp. Since technical interviews focus on data structures and algorithms, I began my interview preparation by beginning the Introduction to the Basic Data Structure Challenges, which can be found here (https://lnkd.in/gZN6FY9). I want to master the basics to succeed in technical interviews.

### Day 10: December 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began the Learn JavaScript course on Code Academy, completed up to lesson 3 of module 2, conditionals.

**Thoughts** For day 10 of 100 days of code, I decided to take a break from my makeup organizer app since I've been stuck and frustrated with it. I plan on returning to it within the next few days. I will be using my coding time in the next few days to really master the basics of JavaScript. My purpose in doing so is to have the skills needed to succeed in a technical interview. I also want to use this time to practice talking through my practice problems as if it were a technical interview. Today, I made it through lesson 1 and began lesson 2 of Code Academy's Learn JavaScript course. While doing this course, I rembered things I have forgotten throughout my coding journey, such as reassigning let variables and that when let variables are not initialized, they will return as undefined.

### Day 11: December 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished conditionals module of Learn JavaScript on Code Academy, began functions module

**Thoughts** For day 11 of 100 days of code, I continued the Learn JavaScript course on Code Academy. I finished the conditionals module and learned a lot of concepts that I have touched on only briefly during my coding journey. They are truthy and falsy, switch statements, ternary operators, and short circuit evaluation. Since these seem to be the current JS best practices, my goal is to further my understanding of these concepts and use them when I code. I also began the functions module I learned in JavaScript. I learned nothing new, but it was nice to review functions in a way that has not been explained to me to deepen my understanding.

### Day 12: December 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished functioms module of Learn JavaScript on Code Academy, began scope module, began The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp on Udemy

**Thoughts** For day 12 of 100 days of code, I finished the functions module of Learn JavaScript on Code Academy. There were ways of doing functions that I have done before and some I have not, like anonymous functions, function expressions, and concise body arrow functions. I also deepened my understanding of helper functions to the point where I think I am comfortable using them. Once I finished this module, I completed the first two, albeit basic, lessons of the scope module. I have learned about scope before and understood it, but focusing on completing a lesson on just code blocks helped me understand scope better. After focusing on JavaScript, I switched to another language I began learning this week in my bootcamp. This whole week, I have been struggling with Python, so I decided to sign-up for the self-paced Modern Python 3 Bootcamp on Udemy. I did not code much, except for the first coding exercise where I had to print my name.

### Day 24: January 10, 2021

**Thoughts**
Concepts Reviewed in Master the Coding Interview:

- Exercise: Google Interview (analyzed a Googel Interview to see how they followed the 15 steps of working through a technical interview problem)

Concepts Reviewed in React with Redux, React-Router, Hooks, and Auth0:

- Getting started with create-react-app, JSX Overview, Displaying Variables in JSX, Understanding Class and Function Scopes, How Extends Component Works, Styling Patterns in React (One in particualr stood out to me, where I add the styling in an object right in the component file. This will definitely help me as I create more complex apps and am better able to keep track of my styling.)

Concepts Reviewed in The Complete Sass & SCSS Course:

- I was not able to review much seeing as I spent about an hour trying to install Sass because I kept getting errors with the command line. I ended up installing Scout, an app that lets you use Sass without the command line. If anyone can help me with installing Sass on the command line, I'm all ears. After installing Scout, I coded along to the next lesson and exposed myself to my first lines of SCSS code. I thought Scout would be easy to use based on the video I saw, but it's not. This whole experience has made me not a big fan of Sass/SCSS so far. Why is it so difficult to install?

Concepts Reviewed in Clean Code:

- Reviwed what is clean code, Key Pain Points (Names, Structure and Comments, Functions, Conditionals and Error Handling, Classes and Data Structures), Clean Code and Patterns & Principles, Clean Code vs Clean Architecture, Clean code is written over time

- Link: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/
- Classes- Introduction to classes, Constructor, Instance, Methods, Method Calls, Inheritance I, began Inheritance II

- Overall, this was a very good day of learning JavaScript for me. It was helpful in letting me understand React on a deeper level.

### Day 26: January 12, 2021

**Thoughts**
Today, I decided to focus solely on Mastering the Coding Interview. With the job search in full swing, I need to brush up on both my behavioral and technical interview skills. I learned a lot about how a computer itslef functions and how that affects how good the code I write is. As I was reviewing arrays and their methods, i began applying big O notation to the methods and it helped me further understand big O.

Concepts reviewed in Master The Coding Interview:

- Link: https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/

- Introduction to data structures: Section Overview (Data Structures vs Algorithms- a data structure is a collection of values, algorithms- the steps/processes we write to manipulate data structure, data structure + algortithms = programs), What is a data structure (a collection of values that have relationships among them and functions applied to them, each data structure is good and is specialized for it's own thing), How computers store data, Data structures in different languages (arrays, stakcs, queues, linked lists, trees, tries, graphs, hash tables), Operations on Data Strcutures

- Arrays: Introduction, Static vs Dynamic Arrays (Static Arrays are fixed in size)

### Day 27: January 13, 2021

### Day 28: January 14, 2021

**Thoughts**
For day 28 of 100 days of code, I went back to working on my apps, specifically Makeup Organizer. I realized I was focusing too much on learning new skills and neglecting the projects I want to perfect. I created my footer component and tried out styled-components. Styled components were a little tricky for me, but this article helped me fully understand them: https://www.edwardbeazer.com/how-to-add-hover-events-to-any-react-component/. I can honestly say that styled-components make my life so much easier and I am never going back to doing all my styling in a separate CSS file. My code is much cleaner and I can actually read it this time around.

### Day 29: January 15, 2021

**Thoughts**
Courses I focused on today:

- GraphQL- A Primer
  - A basic overview of GraphQL, a technology similar to REST that specifies how clients react with servers. Many frontend engineer and developer roles require this skill, which is why I decided to start learning it. GraphQL operations follows a CRUD like structure: queries are responsible for retrieving and mutations, where the existing schema is changes, are responsible for creeating, updating, and deleting. REST and GraphQL both support different HTTP methods usch as GET and POST. GrapphQL, unlike REST, is not resource based, but schema based. Every operation is fully described in a schema file. GraphQL is best used for multiple clients who ask for different subsets of data.
- Webpack 5 Fundamentals
  - I set up and installed Webpack 5. Webpack is another skill I keep seeing in job descriptions so I decided to take this course to learn more about it.

**Thoughts**
What I focused on today:

- Ruby for Absolute Beginners

  - So, I am almost confirmed for a really awesome volunteer opportunity for an area I am knowledgable and passionate about and will add experience to my portfolio. However, Ruby + Rails are part of the stack. Since I have heard it is easy to learn, I decided to sign up for two free courses to learn as much of it as I can before I begin. Today was dedicated to setting up the dev envionment. IT was going ok, since i already have Ruby installed as a MAC user and i figured out hoe to add Java to my .bash profile eventually. However, RubyMine gives me a lot of trouble. It is giving me so much trouble that I gave up fpr the day and will try again tomorrow.

# Day 49: February 22, 2021

**Thoughts**
What I focused on today:

- Began a new project/app called Daily News, which is essentially a single-page app for a user to see current events an news covered by different news sources. For this one, I am experimenting with Next.js, third-part APIs, react-responsive, and jest for testing. Today, I created a next.js app and added the app name and styled it using google fonts and styled components.
- More leetcode

  - did FizzBuzz problem, which I understand on a deep level, as I usually have done and Leetcode would not accept my solution even thoguh it compiled on my local device. Leetcode is dumb but Imma keep doing it.

# Day 50: March 1, 2021

**Thoughts**
What I focused on today:

- Continued working on Daily News application.

# Day 51: March 2, 2021

**Thoughts**
What I focused on today:

- Continued working on Daily News application. I decided to experiment with React Hooks since the way I have done forms before was not working. This is only my second time working with them, but it has been intersting seeing how they can build a search bar that works with a third party API. This article "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-movie-search-app-using-react-hooks-24eb72ddfaf7/" is really hammering in the concepts for me.

# Day 52: March 8, 2021

**Thoughts**
If there is one thing I am learning from this experience, is that I cannot ode everyday for at least 30 minutes. On most days after work, i just want to forget my professional life and not code. I would rather use that time to foster my interests and relationships. In sum, it really showed me how much I value work-life balance anf taking breaks.

What I focused on today:

- back on that LeetCode grind
